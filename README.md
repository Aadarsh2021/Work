**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the TailorTalk Backend Development Internship**

## üü¢ How to Use with Your Own Google Calendar (OAuth 2.0)

This app now supports **OAuth 2.0** so any user (including evaluators) can book events on their own Google Calendar securely.

### **First-Time Setup**
1. **Run the app or test script.**
2. On first use, a browser window will open for you to **sign in with Google** and grant calendar access.
3. After consenting, a `token.json` file will be created and used for future requests.
4. The app will now book events directly on your calendar!

### **Security**
- Your credentials are never shared with the developer‚Äîthey go directly to Google.
- You can revoke access at any time from your Google Account settings.

### **Troubleshooting**
- If you want to re-authenticate, delete `token.json` and restart the app.
- Make sure `credentials.json` is present in the project root (provided with the code).

### **For Evaluators**
- You do **not** need to share your calendar or modify any Google settings.
- Just run the app, sign in, and test booking‚Äîevents will appear on your calendar!
